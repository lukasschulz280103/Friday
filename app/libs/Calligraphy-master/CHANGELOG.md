# 2.0.0 (16/01/2014)
**Breaking changes**
This is a massive rewrite of the interception model. Look at `CalligraphyLayoutInflater` and
`CalligraphyConfig` for more information on options and changes.

- **BREAKING CHANGE** This is an API change to Calligraphy config.
 Changed CalligraphyConfig to a builder pattern, use `CalligraphyConfig.Builder().build()`;

Notable changes:
- Removed jar binary, We build an @aar due to the way we tag `View`s.
- Intercept View creation at each stage.
- Defer view creation to native components (Except CustomViews).
- Inject `setPrivateFactory` on the `Activity`.
- We wrap Factory not disturbing underlying factory and layout inflater invocation.
- Better support for `cloneInContext()` which the compat library uses heavily.

# 1.2.0 (20/10/2014)
- Fixes issues with `appcompat-v7:21+` (uses underlying `Toolbar` impl).
- Lollipop support.
- Fast path view with font already set by us.

# 1.1.0 (02/08/2014)
- Fixes ActionBar Title/SubTitle `textStyles`.
- Fixes `textAllCaps` bug, now works correctly.
- Fixes some `Spannable` issues reported, we are more careful what we apply `Spannable`'s too now.
- Fixes missing Typeface on hint text on `EditText`/`AutoComplete`.
- Fixes empty source and javadoc jars on maven.

# 1.0.0 (05/07/2014)
- Added ActionBar Title/SubTitle support.
- Toast support via default style/or TextView theme style.
